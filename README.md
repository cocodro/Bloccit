##Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io "Bloc Homepage")

Heroku app name: [cocodro-bloccit]
Set-Up:
config/application.yml houses the heroku username, password and secret key, but thees
values should not be duplicated in config/application.example.yml as this is just to
display those variables that are expected by the application
